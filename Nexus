installation of nexus steps followed by valaxytech
and i am not able to login with ip:8081

so I had faced the same issue. I initially ran nexus as a root user and i saw a warning "not advised to run as root user". So I stopped the nexus service, tried to restart with nexus user but it didn't restart. The only reason is, when I first ran the nexus as root user, it created some cache files and log files as a root user.

Our nexus installation is on /opt and our nexus db is on /mnt

Solution:

chown -R nexus:nexus /opt/nexus

and even i dint able get console of nexus 
so i checked the security groups of ec2
then i able to access the console of nexus

2 ways to upload artifacts to nexus
================================================================================================
1:maven by POM.xml,Jenkins will trigger the maven project,so maven will send artifacts to nexus 
2.jenkins to upload artifacts to nexus by nexus plugin 
==================================================================================
here we are seeing how to upload artifacts by maven (POM.xml)
Integration:
1.Install Maven on Jenkins
2.Create a repo in nexus
3.integrate maven with nexus URL

add below lines in POM.xml
<snapshotRepository>
            <id>deployment</id>
            <name>Internal Snapshot Releases</name>
            <url>http://172.31.20.12:8081/repository/maven-snapshots/</url>
            
            http://172.31.20.12:8081/repository/maven-snapshots this is called the URL of nexus along with repo of nexus
            
            now one more step also we need to do is
            ### maven should authenticate to NEXUS####
            add user name of Nexus in Maven configuration file 
            vim /etc/maven/settings.xml
            
            add username and password of nexus
       then it can authenticate
       
       -------------------------------------------------------------------------
       
          and 
          by jenkins console
          1. first install nexus in to servera and start the nexus with nexus user
          2. ip:8081 login for nexus ,login as admin andpassword as admin123
          3.And go to repositories and create a new repo
          4. go to jenkins console and install plugin **** Nexus platform plugin ****
          5.and go to configure system in manage jenkins 
          6. when u install nexus platform plugin u will get 
          Sonatype Nexus
 	Nexus Repository Manager Servers	
Nexus Repository Manager 3.x Server
 	Display Name	
Nexussdlfsdf
 	Server ID	
bvk-nexus
Help for feature: Server ID
 	Server URL	
nexus/
Malformed url (no protocol: nexus/)
 	Credentials	
 
 Test connection

      add credentials in credentials,username and password of nexus
      
      7. then got to jenkins console create a job 
      8.and in the build area , u will find sonatype nexus ,there we will give the path of maven artifacts 
      then build the job..
      
    then after build is sucess u can see repository of nexus
    .................................................
    
    Configure Nexus
Define the ID and URL of your Nexus repository in the projectâ€™s parent pom.xml:

<!-- file: /Users/mincong/demo/pom.xml -->
<project>
  ...
  <distributionManagement>
    <snapshotRepository>
      <id>nexus-snapshots</id>
      <url>http://localhost:8081/repository/maven-snapshots/</url>
    </snapshotRepository>
  </distributionManagement>
</project>
Add username and password in Maven global settings (~/.m2/settings.xml):

<!-- file: /Users/mincong/.m2/settings.xml -->
<settings>
  <servers>
    <server>
      <id>nexus-snapshots</id>
      <username>admin</username>
      <password>admin123</password>
    </server>
  </servers>
</settings>
